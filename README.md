# HDRP-SimpleClouds
Very Simple, 100% Procedural Cloud Shadergraph for Unity HDRP 

This project contains a sample scene, a hemispheric sky dome model (with UV layout), and a shadergraph to generate simple procedural clouds for HDRP. Currently the graph uses an Unlit shader and as such will not be affected by Directional lights.

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for creating a cloud system to be used alongside various sky types in HDRP.

Built with Unity 2019.3.7f1 and HDRP 7.3.1
