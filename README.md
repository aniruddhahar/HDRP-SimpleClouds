# HDRP-SimpleClouds
Very Simple, 100% Procedural Cloud Shadergraph for Unity HDRP 

This project contains a sample scene, a hemispheric sky dome model (with UV layout), and a shadergraph to generate simple procedural clouds for HDRP. Currently the graph uses an Unlit shader and as such will not be affected by Directional lights. The shader uses a simple combination of noise nodes available in shadergraph to create cloud-like visuals.

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for creating a cloud system to be used alongside various sky types in HDRP.

### Instructions

1. Built with Unity 2019.3.7f1 and HDRP 7.3.1
2. Open Samplescene.unity found under Assets\Scenes\
